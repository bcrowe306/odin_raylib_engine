# drives (tests/drive/) and copies each screenshot - with its
# .annotations.json callouts, written by the drive's `annotate` lines - into
# docs/images/<name>.png (the drive's "NN_" prefix dropped). The docs site
# draws the numbered callouts over the image and lists their labels below
# it (scripts/docs/export_site.py). Needs a GPU and, on macOS, an awake
# display, so it runs locally, not in CI; commit docs/images/ afterwards.
