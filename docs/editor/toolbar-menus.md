# Toolbar and menus

The menu bar at the top of the window holds every editor command, and the
toolbar under it holds the ones you use all the time: the transform tools,
undo, play, snapping, view toggles, zoom and save. Every command comes from
one table, so the shortcut a menu shows is the shortcut that works, and the
**command palette** finds any of them by name.

## When to use it

- Switch tools (select, move, rotate, scale, pan) and run the game.
- Save, export, open another project, or change settings.
- Turn viewport overlays on and off (grid, bounds, camera frames, lighting).
- Find a command you don't know the shortcut for: open the palette with
  Cmd+Shift+P (Ctrl+Shift+P) or F1 and type.
- For editing nodes, use the [Scene panel](scene-tree.md) and the
  [Inspector](inspector.md); for moving around the scene, the
  [viewport](viewport.md).

## What's in it

Shortcuts are shown for macOS; on Windows and Linux, Cmd is Ctrl and Opt is
Alt. Ctrl+Tab and the other Ctrl shortcuts use the Control key everywhere.
Change any shortcut in **File > Settings** (Keymap).

### Game / Level tabs

Above the toolbar, two tabs switch the whole window:

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Game** | Scenes, nodes and scripts - the scene editor. Cmd+Shift+1 (Ctrl+Shift+1). |
| **Level** | The LDtk level editor (shows the open `.ldtk` file, a dot when unsaved). Cmd+Shift+2. It has its own toolbar; Play stays. See the [level editor guide](../../engine/docs/level_editor.md). |

### The toolbar

From left to right:

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Project name** (folder icon) | Click for **Project Settings**. Hover for the project's path. |
| **/ scene name** | The active scene. A dot means some open scene has unsaved changes. |
| **Select** | Click to select nodes, drag on empty space for a box selection. **Q** |
| **Move** | Arrows to move the selection (X, Y or both). **W** |
| **Rotate** | A ring to rotate the selection. **E** |
| **Scale** | Handles to scale the selection (X, Y or both). **R** |
| **Pan** | Drag to move the view (the middle mouse button pans with any tool). **T** |
| **Undo / Redo** | Undo and redo scene edits. Cmd+Z (Ctrl+Z) / Cmd+Shift+Z (Cmd+Y also redoes). |
| **Play** (green) | Play the project from its startup scene. Saves your changes first and rebuilds if code changed. **F5** |
| **Play Scene** (green circle) | Play only the current scene. **F6** |
| **Colliders** (square) | Whether the running game draws collision shapes. Lit = shown. Also switches a game that is already running. |

| **Snap to grid** (magnet) | Moves, guides and shape handles snap to the grid. Shift+S |
| **Grid size** | The grid step in pixels (drag or type, 4 to 256). |
| **Show grid** | The background grid and the origin axes. Shift+G |
| **Show bounds & colliders** (eye) | Outlines every node and its collision shapes, not only the selected ones. |
| **Show camera frames** (camera) | Draws each camera's frame: what the game will show. |
| **Screen shape** | Only with the project's **Screen Fill: Expand**. Picks the screen shape to preview (16:9, 16:10, 4:3, 21:9, phone portrait). |
| **Preview lighting** (sun) | Shows lights, the scene's ambient light and post effects in the viewport. |
| **Fit** | Zoom to show the whole scene. **Home** |
| **Zoom** (100%) | Pick 25%, 50%, 100%, 200%, 400%, or **Fit Scene**, **Fit Game View**, **Fit Selection**. |
| **Save** (disk) | Save the active scene. Turns orange when there are unsaved changes. Cmd+S |
| **Export** (box) | Export a `.rayzr` package (asks for a folder). |
| **Settings** (gear) | Project Settings. |

While the game runs, Play and Play Scene become:

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Pause / Resume** | Pause the game, or resume it. **F9** |
| **Step** | Pause and run one frame. Shift+F9 |
| **Restart** | Save, rebuild if needed, and play the same again. Cmd+Shift+F5 |
| **Stop** (red) | Stop the game. Shift+F5 |

While a build runs, the red button cancels the build.

## Walkthrough

Try a change and see it in the game:

1. Press **W** for the Move tool and click a node in the viewport.
2. Click the magnet (or press Shift+S) so it snaps, and set the grid size
   to `16`.
3. Drag the node's arrows. It moves in 16 px steps.
4. Press Cmd+S (Ctrl+S). The toolbar's save button stops being orange.
5. Press **F6** to play the scene. The status shows *Running*.
6. Press **F9** to pause, then Shift+F9 to step one frame at a time.
7. Click the colliders button to see the collision shapes in the running
   game, then press Shift+F5 to stop.
8. Can't remember a command? Press F1, type `fit`, and pick
   **Fit Selection**.

## Tips

- **Simulate** (F7) has no toolbar button: use the Game menu or F7. Edits
  made while simulating are thrown away when you stop.
- Play and Restart save your changes before they start the game.
- Shortcuts don't fire while you type in a text field, and the Code tab
  has its own keys when it has focus.
- Two shortcuts on one key? Settings > Keymap flags the conflict.
- More: [editor tour](tour.md), [viewport](viewport.md),
  [Scene panel](scene-tree.md), [Inspector](inspector.md),
  [pixel-perfect settings](../../engine/docs/pixel_perfect.md).
