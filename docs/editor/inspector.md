# Inspector

The Inspector edits the selected node: its name, its transform and draw
order, its type's own settings, its tags, material, script and signals.
Every edit can be undone, every value has a reset button when it differs
from the default, and hovering any property tells you what it does and how
a script reaches it.

## When to use it

- Change a node's position, rotation, scale, origin or draw order exactly.
- Set a node type's settings: a sprite's texture, a timer's duration, a
  body's collision shapes, a camera's follow target...
- Attach a script and set its properties per node (the **Properties**
  tab).
- Connect a node's events (signals) to script methods.
- Edit several nodes at once.
- To pick and arrange nodes, use the [Scene panel](scene-tree.md); to
  move them by eye, the [viewport](viewport.md).

## What's in it

### Header

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Icon and name** | Type a new name and press Enter. Scripts that use the old name are offered an update. |
| **Power** button | Enable or disable the node. A disabled node doesn't update or collide. |
| **Eye** button | Show or hide the node. |
| **?** button | The node type's documentation. Shift+F1 |
| **Type** (under the name) | The node's type, for example `TimerNode`. A custom type shows as `Hurtbox (AreaNode)`. |

The power and eye buttons apply to every selected node. The scene root has
only its name.

### Banners

- **N nodes selected**: several nodes are selected (see
  [Multi-select](#multi-select)).
- **Component instance** (purple): the node comes from a component file.
  Your changes are saved as overrides on this instance. **Edit Component**
  opens the file; **Revert** drops the overrides (listed in orange);
  **Unlink** turns the instance into ordinary nodes. A red message means
  the component file can't be loaded.

### Node and Properties tabs

- **Node**: the node's own settings - everything below.
- **Properties (N)**: your properties, from the node's script. **Add
  Property** opens a dialog: name, type (number, integer, boolean, text,
  resource, node, choice, range, vector, colour, assets, list, curve,
  gradient), default, limits, label, help and group. It previews the Lua
  line and writes it into the script's `properties` table. A node without
  a script gets one made for it. The script is shared: the dialog says how
  many nodes use it.

Right-click a property's name in the Properties tab for **Edit Property...**
(a rename keeps each node's value) and **Remove Property...** (it shows the
script lines and nodes that use it; undo brings it back).

### Instance

On a component instance's root: the properties the component exposes.
Editing one edits that node inside the instance. In the component's own
document, right-click a property's name and pick **Expose on Instances**
(**Stop Exposing** undoes it); the root's **Exposed on Instances** section lists and removes them.

### Transform

Not shown for the scene root.

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Position** | X and Y, relative to the parent. |
| **Origin** | Nodes that draw an image or a box only. The point of the image at the node's position, as a fraction of its size: **0.5, 0.5** is the centre (the default), **0, 0** the top-left. Hover for the value in pixels. **Presets** picks a corner, an edge's middle or the centre. |
| **Rotation** | Degrees. |
| **Scale** | X and Y. Linked by default: changing one scales the other by the same ratio. |
| **Layer** | Layer 1 (back) to Layer 8 (UI). |
| **Z Index** | Draw order within the layer, added to the parent's. Higher draws on top. |
| **Y Sort Children** | Draw the children by their Y (lower on screen = in front), for top-down and isometric depth. |
| **Y Sort Offset** | Only under a Y-sorted parent. Moves the line it sorts by (drawn dashed in the viewport while selected). |
| **Pause Mode** | **Inherit**, **Pausable** (stops when the game or its parent pauses), **Always** (keeps running - pause menus). |
| **Paused** | Pauses this node and its children while the game runs. |

X / Y pairs have a **link** button: linked, editing one changes the other
by the same ratio.

### The node type's sections

What comes next depends on the node's type. Some examples:

| Section | Node types | What's in it |
|---|---|---|
| **Sprite** | Texture | The texture (picked from the project) and its size and preview. |
| **Atlas Sprite** | Atlas Sprite | The texture and **Edit Region...**. |
| **Animation** | Frame animations | The frames. |
| **Audio** | Sound, Music | The sounds or the track. |
| **Timer** | Timer | Duration, Auto Start, Loop. |
| **LDtk Level** | LDtk Level | The level; **Edit in Level Tab**, **Open in LDtk**. |
| **Collision Shapes** | Static, Dynamic, Area, Character Mover | Each shape's type and size; **Add Shape**, a bin to remove one, **Edit in Viewport**. |
| **Follow** | Camera | **Follow Target**: pick a node, or drop one from the Scene panel. |
| **Animation Player** | Animation Player | The **Current** animation, a **Play** / **Stop** preview, the list of animations, **Slice a Sprite Sheet...**. **Open Animation Timeline** opens the bottom panel's Animation tab. |
| **Points** | Path, Line | The points; **Add Point**, smooth / sharp corners, remove. |
| **Spawn List** | Spawner | Components, weights, counts; **Spawn Now** while simulating. |
| **Navigation** | Navigation Region | **Bake**. |
| **Joint Bodies** | Joint | The two bodies it connects. |
| **Font**, **Texture** | Text, Dialogue; Nine-Slice, Parallax | The font or texture file. |

Particle emitters get **Open Particle Editor** (the bottom panel's
Particles tab). Each node type's page in the
[node reference](../nodes/Node.md) lists its settings.

### Properties

The rest of the type's settings, generated from the engine, so every
setting has a widget: numbers, checkboxes, colours, choices, node and asset
pickers, collision layers. Settings that don't apply in the node's current
mode are hidden (a Character Mover in Script mode hides its movement
settings).

**Runtime State** (closed by default) shows values the node works out
while running. They are read-only and not saved.

### Tags, Material, Script, Signals

- **Tags**: type a tag and press Enter, or pick one used in the scene from
  the list. Click a tag to remove it. Scripts use `has_tag` and
  `Scene.find_by_tag`; the Scene panel filters with `#tag`.
- **Material**: the node's **Shader** and **Blend** mode.
- **Script**: without one, pick a script from `scripts/` or **New
  Script...**. With one: the **Module** picker, **Edit** (open it),
  **Extend** (a new script built on this one, attached instead, the node's
  values kept), **Detach**, and a button to its properties in the
  Properties tab.
- **Signals**: every event the node sends (`timeout`, `body_entered`,
  `clicked`...), with what it passes. **+** connects one to a method on
  any node's script: the handler is written into the script (a script is
  made if the target has none). Each connection shows its target and
  method, with buttons to **open the handler** and **disconnect** (it
  removes the generated handler, asking first if you added code). A
  `self:on_<event>()` line means the node's own script handles it.
- **Component**: **Save as Component** saves this node and its children
  in `components/`.

Plugins can add their own sections.

### Reset buttons

A reset arrow appears after a field whenever its value differs from the
default - the node type's default, or a script property's declared
default. Click it to go back.

### Multi-select

Select several nodes (Cmd+click in the tree or viewport, or drag a box).
The Inspector shows the primary node under a banner, with only the
properties they all have. A value that differs shows **—**. Editing a
field (or resetting it) changes every selected node; for X / Y pairs only
the axis you changed, so different positions keep their other coordinate.
The enable and visible buttons and tags apply to all; the script,
material and signals sections edit the primary node only.

### Help

Hover any property's name or field for a tooltip: what it does, its type,
range and default, and `path = "..."` - what `get_property` and
`set_property` take. The **help pane** at the bottom keeps the last
hovered property's help (with a **copy** button for the path), or
describes the selected node type. Turn it off with **View > Inspector
Help**. A script's own properties have paths like `script.speed`.

### Property menu

Right-click a property's name:

- **Copy Path** - the `get_property` path.
- **Find in Script** - script properties: open the script at its
  declaration.
- **Edit Property... / Remove Property...** - script properties.
- **Revert to Component / Apply to Component** - a value changed on a
  component instance (its name is coloured).

While you edit an animation, a diamond after a property's name keys it:
click to add a key at the playhead, right-click for the previous / next
key or to remove one.

### Drag into a script

- **A property's name** into a script in the Code tab inserts a read:
  `self.node:get_property("rotation")`. Hold **Shift** when you drop for a
  write with the current value: `self.node:set_property("rotation", 45)`.
  The node is `self.node` when the script is its own, otherwise a
  `get_node("...")` path to it.
- **An event** from the Signals section inserts a `connect` call with its
  handler.
- **A node** from the Scene panel inserts a typed reference:

```lua
---@type CharacterMoverNode
local player = self.node:get_node("../Player")
```

## Walkthrough

Make a timer that spawns enemies:

1. Add a **Timer** node and name it `SpawnTimer` in the Inspector's name
   field.
2. In the **Timer** section set **Duration** to `2` and tick **Loop** and
   **Auto Start**.
3. Hover **Duration**: the help pane shows what it does and
   `path = "duration"`.
4. Open the **Signals** section. Next to `timeout`, click **+**.
5. In the dialog pick the node that should spawn (say `Spawner`), type the
   method name `spawn_enemy` and click **Connect**. The handler is written
   into Spawner's script.
6. Select Spawner, open the **Properties** tab and click **Add
   Property**. Name it `max_enemies`, type integer, default `10`. The line
   appears in the script's `properties` table.
7. Set `max_enemies` to `5` on this node. The reset arrow appears; click it
   to go back to `10`.
8. Drag the **Duration** name from the timer's Inspector into the script,
   holding Shift, to get `set_property("duration", 2)`.

## Tips

- An edit to a component instance is an override; right-click the
  property to **Apply to Component** for every instance.
- Scale fields start linked; position fields start unlinked.
- With nothing selected (or the scene root), **Scene Settings...** opens
  the Scene panel's Settings tab.
- While the game runs, pick **Remote** in the Scene panel: the Inspector
  then shows and changes the running game's node.
