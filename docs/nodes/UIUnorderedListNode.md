## What it's for

A Bullet List (an unordered list, like HTML's `<ul>`) shows rows of text
with a bullet in front of each, in a framed box that scrolls. Rows can be
indented, styled as sub-headings and carry a small badge. A click selects
a row. Use it for objectives, credits, patch notes or an inventory read-out.

## When to use it

- **A read-out list** where order doesn't matter: quest objectives, a
  character's traits, the items found.
- **Grouped rows**: headings with indented entries under them.
- **Not** for steps in order: use a [Numbered List](UIOrderedListNode.md).
- **Not** for a plain pick-one list driven by keys or a gamepad: use a
  [List View](UIListViewNode.md).
- **Not** for rows with several columns: use a [Table](UITableNode.md).
- **Not** for expandable groups: use a [Tree View](UITreeViewNode.md).

## Using it

1. **Add Node** (Ctrl+A) > *UI Bullet List*. It starts 320 x 220 px with no
   rows.
2. Put it under a [Screen Layer](ScreenLayerNode.md), or in a
   [UI Container](UIContainerNode.md).
3. In the Node tab's **Properties** section pick a **Default Bullet** (Disc,
   Circle, Square, Dash or Arrow), set **Item Height** (16 to 48 px) and
   **Selected Index** (the highlighted row, from 0).

Set the items in the Node tab's **Items** box, one a line; two spaces at
the start nest an item a level deeper. Scripts:
`node:ui_set_items({"Find the key", "  Ask the guard"})`.

## How it works

- **Layout**: the node's position is the top-left corner and **Size** the
  width and height. Rotation and scale don't change it. The list has a dark
  frame with a border; rows start 6 px from the top, **Item Height** each.
- **Rows**: each row is indented 20 px per level, then the bullet, then the
  text. A heading row is drawn a little larger and brighter. A badge sits at
  the right end of its row. A row can have its own bullet instead of the
  default.
- **Scrolling**: rows that don't fit scroll in the box, which clips them.
- **Selection**: the selected row is filled blue. A click on another row
  selects it and raises `selected`.
- **In the world or on screen**: under a [Screen Layer](ScreenLayerNode.md)
  it stays on screen; outside one it's drawn in the world (the camera moves
  it) and reads the mouse there too, so clicks line up either way.

## Signals

| Signal | When | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `selected` | A click selects a different row | The row's index (from 0) |

## Example

Change the bullet style and react to a click on a row.

```lua
---@class Objectives : ScriptInstanceBase
local Objectives = {}

function Objectives:ready()
    self.node.defaultBullet = "Arrow"
    self.node.selectedIndex = -1
end

function Objectives:on_selected(index)
    Log.info("Objective " .. (index + 1) .. " picked")
end

return Objectives
```

The script is on the list itself, so `on_selected` receives its `selected`
signal.
