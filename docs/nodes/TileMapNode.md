## What it's for

A Tile Map is a grid of tiles cut from one tileset image, painted in the
viewport. Ground, walls, floors and platforms built from small square
pieces. With **Solid** on, the painted tiles become colliders. The same grid
can also hold components - coins, enemies, spikes - one per cell.

## When to use it

- **Levels built in the scene**: paint the ground and walls of a room
  directly in the viewport.
- **Generated levels**: a [Level Generator](LevelGeneratorNode.md) writes
  its output into a Tile Map.
- **Walls for path finding**: enemies find their way round a Solid map with
  `nav_find_path`.
- **Placing many copies of a component on a grid**: the Tile Map tab's
  **Components** layer.
- **Not** for levels with many layers, auto-tiling rules and entities with
  fields: use an [LDtk Tilemap Level](LdtkLevelNode.md) (edited in LDtk or
  the Level tab).
- **Isometric and hex maps**: set the tab's **Grid** to Isometric,
  Staggered or Hex, and the cells become diamonds or hexagons.
- **Not** for one picture: use a [Texture Sprite](TextureNode.md).

## Using it

1. **Add Node** (Ctrl+A) > *Tile Map*. The bottom panel switches to the
   **Tile Map** tab (the Inspector's **Edit in Tile Map Tab** button opens
   it too).
2. In the tab's top row, pick the **Tileset** image, set **Tile Size** (the
   size of one tile in the image, in pixels) and **Map Size** (columns and
   rows). Or right-click an image in Assets > **Use as Tileset of Selected
   Tile Map**.
3. Click a tile in the tile list, then paint in the viewport with the left
   button. The tools: **Paint**, **Erase**, **Fill** (flood fill). The
   right button always erases. One stroke is one undo step.
4. For an isometric or hex map, pick the **Grid** in the same row and set
   the **Cell** size: the diamond or hexagon the tiles sit on. For example,
   64 x 32 diamonds for 64 x 64 block tiles. Staggered and hex grids also
   have **Odd shifted**, which picks whether the odd or the even rows (Hex
   Flat: columns) are pushed over by half a cell.
5. The **-** / **+** buttons size the tile list; the grid button joins the
   tiles with lines between them.
6. Tick **Solid** in the Node tab's **Properties** section to make the painted tiles block bodies.
7. To paint components instead of tiles, switch to the **Components** layer
   (next to **Tiles**), pick a component, and paint. Shift places one off
   the grid.

## How it works

- Cell (0, 0)'s box (its bounding rectangle) has its top-left corner at
  the node's position. Cells count right and down; tiles are drawn at
  **Tile Size** times the node's scale. The node can be rotated.
- **Grids**: Square cells sit in rows and columns. *Isometric* cells
  are diamonds on a grid turned 45 degrees: x runs down-right and y
  down-left from the top corner. *Staggered* cells are diamonds in rows,
  every other row shifted half a cell. *Hex (pointy)* and *Hex (flat)* are
  hexagons in offset rows or columns. Painting, Fill, picking
  (`tilemap_cell_at`), `tilemap_cell_position` and **Solid** follow the
  grid; `tilemap_neighbors(x, y)` lists a cell's 4 (hex: 6) neighbours.
- **Cell** is the grid's cell (left at the tile size, square maps work as
  they always did). A tile taller than its cell, such as a wall or a block,
  stands on its cell: drawn bottom-aligned and centred across, so its top
  reaches over the cells behind it. Tiles are drawn back to front.
- **Y Sort** (Node tab): walk behind walls. Put the map and the
  characters under one node with **Y Sort** on, and turn **Y Sort** on for
  the map too. Its rows (isometric: diagonals) then sort one by one with
  the characters, by the bottom of their cells: a character standing
  behind a wall is hidden by it, one in front is drawn over it. Use it for
  the map of walls and blocks, not the floor: keep the floor in a map of
  its own without Y Sort.
- Tile numbers count left to right, then top to bottom in the tileset
  image (the tooltip in the tile list shows them).
- **Map Size** is the map's outline. You can paint outside it, and making
  the map smaller never deletes tiles: they are kept and come back when
  it grows.
- **Solid**: when the scene starts (or Simulate), the map makes a static
  body child named `<Name>_Colliders`, with one box per horizontal run of
  painted tiles (isometric: one slanted shape per run; staggered and hex:
  one per cell, the cell's shape). Its colliders also cast [Light](LightNode.md) shadows.
  They are not saved and aren't there while you edit.
- **Terrains** (auto-tiling): a tileset's terrains - kept next to its
  image in `<name>.tileset.json` - give each cell the tile for its pattern
  of same-terrain neighbours (16 edge patterns, the 47-tile blob, or 64
  hex patterns). Paint them on the Tile Map tab's Terrains layer; a Level
  Generator rule can name one. From Odin: `TileMapNode_PaintTerrain`,
  `TileMapNode_FillTerrain` (engine/terrain.odin). On isometric and
  staggered maps the patterns' north is the diamond's upper-right side and
  east its lower-right one. On hex maps use the **Hex** kind: its six sides
  count clockwise from the right (Hex Pointy) or the top (Hex Flat).
- Large square maps are drawn as cached chunks, so many tiles cost
  little. Isometric, staggered and hex maps, square maps with a Cell size
  other than the tile size, and maps with Y Sort are drawn tile by tile
  (only those in view).
- **Path finding** (`nav_find_path`) follows the grid. Isometric maps
  step in 8 directions like square ones; staggered and hex maps step to
  the cells sharing a side (hex: six). A Navigation Region bakes a solid
  map's diamonds and hexagons as they are.
- A **Level Generator** fills any grid. It makes its shapes in rows and
  columns of cells, so on staggered and hex maps they come out slanted a
  little; its terrains and entities follow the map's grid.
- Components take one cell each on isometric, staggered and hex maps
  (larger footprints are for square maps).
- **Tint** multiplies the colours of every tile.
- **Aseprite Layer**: with an Aseprite file as the tileset, the map is that
  file's tilemap layer (its tiles, flips and tileset), updated when the file
  is saved. Leave it empty to paint the map here. See
  [Aseprite files](../../engine/docs/aseprite.md).
- Filtering comes from the tileset image's import settings (Point by
  default, for crisp pixel art).
- New tile maps are 20 x 12 cells of 32 x 32 pixels, on Layer1. See
  [Draw order](../../engine/docs/draw_order.md).

## Example

An enemy that walks round the walls of a Solid Tile Map towards the player.
The script is on the enemy, at the scene root, so its position is a world
position.

```lua
---@class Chaser : ScriptInstanceBase
local Chaser = {}

Chaser.properties = {
    speed = { type = "float", default = 80, label = "Speed" },
    walls = { type = "node", label = "Walls" },   -- the Tile Map (Solid on)
    target = { type = "node", label = "Target" }, -- the player
}

function Chaser:ready()
    self.repath = 0
end

function Chaser:update(dt)
    local x, y = self.node:get_global_position()
    self.repath = self.repath - dt
    if self.repath <= 0 then
        local tx, ty = self.target:get_global_position()
        -- Waypoints round the painted tiles, keeping 12 px from them.
        self.path = self.walls:nav_find_path(x, y, tx, ty, { radius = 12 })
        self.next = 2 -- path[1] is where the enemy is
        self.repath = 0.5
    end
    local p = self.path and self.path[self.next]
    if not p then return end
    local dx, dy = p[1] - x, p[2] - y
    local d = math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)
    if d < 4 then
        self.next = self.next + 1
        return
    end
    self.node:set_position(x + dx / d * self.speed * dt, y + dy / d * self.speed * dt)
end

return Chaser
```

`nav_find_path` returns nil when there is no way, or when either end is
blocked or off the map's grid; the enemy then waits for the next search.

Components on the grid from a script (cells are 0-based):

```lua
local map = Scene.find_node("TileMap") ---@type TileMapNode
map:tilemap_set_component(4, 2, "components/Coin.component.json")
local coin = map:tilemap_component_at(4, 2)
map:tilemap_clear_component(4, 2)
```

Tiles from a script: read and paint cells (a tile is its index in the
tileset; -1 is empty). On a **Solid** map the colliders follow at the end
of the frame, and path finding sees the change - dig a hole under the
player:

```lua
local map = Scene.find_node("TileMap") ---@type TileMapNode
local x, y = map:tilemap_cell_at(self.node:get_global_position())
if map:tilemap_get_tile(x, y + 1) ~= -1 then
    map:tilemap_set_tile(x, y + 1, -1)
end
local wx, wy = map:tilemap_cell_position(x, y + 1) -- that cell's centre
```
