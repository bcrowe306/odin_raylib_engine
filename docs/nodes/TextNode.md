## What it's for

A Text node draws text in the world: a sign, a damage number, a name over a
character, a title, a typed-out message. It uses any font in the project,
wraps and aligns lines, understands colour, size, wave and shake tags, can
show a translation, and can type itself out letter by letter.

## When to use it

- **Text that belongs to the world**: signs, labels over characters,
  floating score numbers, a title in a menu scene.
- **A typewriter message**: set **Reveal Speed** and wait for `revealed`.
- **Not** for a HUD that stays on screen while the camera moves: put the
  text under a [Screen Layer](ScreenLayerNode.md) (or use a
  [UI Label](UILabelNode.md) there).
- **Not** for conversations with speakers and lines: a
  [Dialogue Box](DialogueNode.md) types lines and waits for the player.

## Using it

1. **Add Node** (Ctrl+A) > *Text*. It shows "Text" in the engine font.
2. Type in **Text** (the Inspector's Node tab, **Properties** section). With **Rich Text**
   on (the default) you can mark it up:
   `[color=yellow]gold[/color]`, `[size=40]big[/size]`, `[wave]...[/wave]`,
   `[shake]...[/shake]`.
3. Pick a font in the **Font** section: a `.ttf` / `.otf` / `.fnt` file in
   the project. *None* is the engine font.
4. Set **Font Size** (pixels), **Color**, **Align** (Left, Center, Right),
   **Max Width** (wrap at this width; 0 wraps only at line breaks) and
   **Line Spacing** (times the font size).
5. For text that scales or zooms, tick **Sdf** (with a `.ttf` / `.otf`
   font): it stays sharp at any size.
6. For a typewriter, set **Reveal Speed** (characters per second).
7. For a translated text, tick **Localized** and type a key of the locale
   tables in **Text**.

## How it works

- **Origin** (in Transform) is a fraction of the text block: the centre by
  default. (0, 0) puts the top-left of the first line at the node's
  position. The block's size follows the text, so the origin stays at the
  same fraction when the text changes.
- **Align** lines up the lines inside the block; it doesn't move the block.
- Scale: the text scales by the node's X scale on both axes.
- Fonts: a `.ttf` / `.otf` is drawn at the size asked; with **Sdf** it is
  drawn from a distance field and stays sharp when scaled or zoomed. A `.fnt`
  (BMFont) is used as drawn. Characters are basic Latin, Latin-1 and common
  punctuation (quotes, dashes, the euro sign).
- Rich text tags: `[color=...]` takes a name (white, black, red, green,
  blue, yellow, orange, purple, gray) or `#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa`;
  `[size=N]` is pixels; `[wave]` and `[shake]` move the letters. Close a tag
  with `[/color]`, `[/size]` and so on. `[[` shows a `[`. Unknown tags are
  shown as typed. A `[color]` overrides **Color**.
- **Localized**: **Text** is a key of the CSV tables in `locale/`; the node
  shows the current language's text (see the scripting guide's
  [Text, dialogue and localization](../../engine/SCRIPTING.md)).
- Typewriter: with **Reveal Speed** above 0, characters appear one by one
  (markup tags don't count). `set_text` and `text_restart()` start it
  again.
- New Text nodes are on Layer4, in front of sprites on layers 1-3. See
  [Draw order](../../engine/docs/draw_order.md).

## Signals

| Signal | When | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `revealed` | The typewriter has shown the last character (only with **Reveal Speed** above 0) | none |

## Example

A sign that types its message when the player comes near. The script is on
a Trigger Area; the Text node is its child named `Message`, with
**Reveal Speed** at 30.

```lua
---@class Sign : ScriptInstanceBase
local Sign = {}

Sign.properties = {
    message = { type = "string", default = "Beware of [color=red]bats[/color]!", label = "Message" },
}

function Sign:ready()
    self.text = self.node:get_node("Message") ---@type TextNode
    self.text:set_visible(false)
    self.text:connect("revealed", function()
        Log.info("The sign has been read")
    end)
end

function Sign:on_body_entered(body)
    if body == nil or body:get_name() ~= "Player" then return end
    self.text:set_visible(true)
    self.text:set_text(self.message) -- restarts the typewriter
end

function Sign:on_body_exited(body)
    if body ~= nil and body:get_name() == "Player" then
        self.text:set_visible(false)
    end
end

return Sign
```

A score label is one line: `label:set_text("Score: " .. self.score)`.
`get_text()` reads the text back.
