# Procedural levels (level generator)

A **generator** builds a level from a graph of nodes, in the style of the
Gaea add-on for Godot: some nodes make a grid of values (noise, random
fill, shapes), others change it (threshold, cave smoothing, blur, combine),
and the **tile output** turns values into tiles and writes them into a
TileMap. The same generator and **seed** always give the same level, on
every platform - so a seed is a level you can share, replay or test.

So far (#142): the generator file, the nodes (terrain, caves, rooms and
corridors, walkers), placing entities, TileMap and LDtk output, your own
nodes (Lua or Odin), the **Level Generator** node that makes levels in
the game, the Lua module and the **Level Generator** window in the editor.

## In the editor

**Assets > + > New Level Generator** creates `levels/new_level.levelgen.json`
(a cave) and opens it in the **Level Generator** window; double-click any
`.levelgen.json` to open it. The window docks like any panel.

- **The canvas** shows the nodes, each with a thumbnail of its grid (a
  tile output shows its tiles in colours; a red border: the node can't be
  computed - its error is in the side panel). Drag a node by its title;
  drag from a node's **output** (the green dot on its right) onto another's
  **input** (a dot on its left) to connect them - a link that would make a
  loop is refused; right-click an input to disconnect it. Right-click the
  canvas to add a node; right-click a node to duplicate it, delete it or
  use it as the output. Delete removes the selected node. The wheel pans,
  Ctrl/Cmd+wheel zooms, F frames everything.
- **The side panel**: the level's **size**, **seed** (the dice picks a new
  one) and **output**; the selected node's parameters and, for a tile
  output, its **rules** (a range and tiles: `3, 4` picks one of them per
  cell); a large **preview** of the selected node (or the output).
- **The toolbar**: **Save** (Ctrl/Cmd+S), **Undo** / **Redo**
  (Ctrl/Cmd+Z, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z: every change), and **Apply to TileMap**,
  which writes the level into the TileMap selected in the scene - baked
  into the scene to paint over by hand; the scene's undo takes it back.

Closing the window with unsaved changes asks first.

The previews are made on a worker thread after each change, so the window
stays responsive while you drag a value: only the nodes the change reaches
are computed again (the rest are kept from the last time). Script files are
read when the generator opens, when a node's script is picked, and on
**Reload**. Levels up to 1024 x 1024 cells are previewed.

## Speed

A generator is computed node by node, each node once: the heavy nodes
(cellular automaton, blur, dilate / erode, noise, random fill) share their
rows among a few worker threads on big enough grids, and work on flat rows
- the automaton on bytes with a border of cells all round, blur as two
sliding sums (any radius costs the same), noise from a precomputed lattice.
A 256 x 256 cave with noise, blur and scatter takes about 1.5 ms in an
optimized build (`scripts/bench.sh engine`, `bench_level_gen`).

Builds without optimization (`task editor:build`, `task run`) are about 8x
slower at this kind of work: to play-test, use **`task editor:run:fast`**
(the editor and the Play game built with `-o:speed`), as exported games and
packaged editors are.

## A cave level

```json
{"size": [64, 40], "seed": 7, "nodes": [
  {"id": 1, "type": "random_fill", "params": {"density": 0.48}},
  {"id": 2, "type": "cellular", "inputs": {"in": 1}, "params": {"iterations": 5}},
  {"id": 3, "type": "border", "params": {"width": 1}},
  {"id": 4, "type": "combine", "inputs": {"a": 2, "b": 3}, "params": {"op": "max"}},
  {"id": 5, "type": "tile_output", "inputs": {"in": 4},
   "rules": [{"min": 0.5, "max": 1, "tiles": [12, 13, 14]}]}
]}
```

Random fill scatters walls; the cellular automaton smooths them into cave
walls and open rooms; the border closes the edges; the tile output puts one
of tiles 12-14 (picked at random, the same for a seed) on every wall cell.
Save it as `levels/caves.levelgen.json` and generate from a script:

```lua
function Level:ready()
    local ok, why = LevelGen.generate("levels/caves.levelgen.json", self.node:get_node("Ground"), Save.get("seed", 7))
    if not ok then Log.error(why) end
end
```

The TileMap (with a tileset, **Solid** on for colliders) takes the
generator's size and its cells become the tiles; its colliders are rebuilt.

## Terrain (a side view)

```json
{"size": [120, 40], "seed": 3, "nodes": [
  {"id": 1, "type": "gradient", "params": {"direction": "vertical"}},
  {"id": 2, "type": "noise", "params": {"scale": 18, "octaves": 4}},
  {"id": 3, "type": "remap", "inputs": {"in": 2}, "params": {"to_min": -0.25, "to_max": 0.25}},
  {"id": 4, "type": "combine", "inputs": {"a": 1, "b": 3}, "params": {"op": "add"}},
  {"id": 5, "type": "tile_output", "inputs": {"in": 4}, "rules": [
     {"min": 0.55, "max": 0.62, "tile": 1},
     {"min": 0.62, "max": 9, "tile": 2}]}
]}
```

A top-to-bottom ramp plus noise makes rolling ground: values from 0.55 get
grass (tile 1) and deeper ones dirt (tile 2); above stays empty.

## The file

| Key | |
|---|---|
| `size` | `[width, height]` in cells (1-4096). |
| `seed` | The default seed (scripts can pass another). |
| `output` | The id of the node whose result is the level (default: the last tile output). |
| `nodes` | Each with an `id` (a positive number), its `type`, `inputs` (port -> id of the node it reads), `params` (missing ones take their defaults), and for the tile output `rules`; `pos` is where the editor draws it. |

Every port carries a grid of numbers the size of the level - usually 0
(empty / low) to 1 (solid / high). An input that isn't connected reads 0
everywhere. A node may feed any number of others (computed once); a cycle
is an error.

## Nodes

**Generators**

| Type | Parameters | |
|---|---|---|
| `constant` | `value` (1) | The same value everywhere. |
| `noise` | `scale` (16), `octaves` (3), `persistence` (0.5), `seed` (0) | Smooth value noise (fBm), 0..1. |
| `random_fill` | `density` (0.45), `seed` (0) | Each cell 1 with that chance, else 0. |
| `gradient` | `direction`: `horizontal` (0 left .. 1 right), `vertical` (0 top .. 1 bottom), `radial` (1 centre .. 0 corners) | A ramp. |
| `border` | `width` (1) | 1 within that many cells of the edge. |
| `rect` | `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` (8), `value` (1) | A filled rectangle. |
| `rooms` | `min_size` (4), `max_size` (10), `corridor` (1), `seed` (0) | A dungeon: the level split in two again and again (BSP), a room in each part, corridors joining every split - every room reachable. 1 = floor (invert it for walls). |
| `walker` | `steps` (400), `walkers` (1), `brush` (1), `seed` (0) | Random walks from the centre ("drunkard's walk"): winding tunnels and caverns. 1 = walked. |

**Modifiers** (input `in`, or `a` and `b`)

| Type | Parameters | |
|---|---|---|
| `threshold` | `value` (0.5), `invert` (false) | 1 at or above the value, else 0. |
| `invert` | | 1 - value. |
| `remap` | `from_min`, `from_max` (0, 1), `to_min`, `to_max` (0, 1) | One range onto another (clamped). |
| `blur` | `radius` (1) | The average of each cell's square of neighbours. |
| `cellular` | `iterations` (4), `birth` (5), `survive` (4), `edge_solid` (true) | Cave smoothing: an empty cell with at least `birth` solid neighbours (of 8) becomes solid, a solid one with fewer than `survive` empties. |
| `dilate` / `erode` | `iterations` (1) | Grow / shrink solid areas a cell at a time. |
| `combine` | `op`: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `min`, `max`, `mask` (a where b is solid), `average` | Two grids into one. |
| `scatter` | `chance` (0.05), `spacing` (4), `seed` (0) | Random points (1), at least `spacing` cells apart - on the input's solid cells when it is connected, anywhere otherwise. |
| `surface` | `side`: `top` (empty cells with solid below: ground to stand on), `bottom` (solid above: ceilings), `any` | Empty cells against the input's solid ones. |

**Your own** (see [Your own nodes](#your-own-nodes))

| Type | Parameters | |
|---|---|---|
| `script` | `p1`..`p4` (0), `seed` (0); inputs `a`, `b`; `script` (a `.lua` file) | A Lua function computes the grid. |
| *(registered)* | its own | A node type registered from Odin, by its name. |

**Output**

| Type | | |
|---|---|---|
| `tile_output` | `empty` (-1), `rules` | Each cell takes the first rule whose `min`..`max` holds its value: one of its `tiles` (or `tile`), picked by the cell and the seed. Cells no rule takes get `empty` (-1: none). |
| `entity_output` | `max` (0 = all), `component` | Its component (a `.component.json`) on every point of its input (cells >= 0.5) - `max` of them picked by the seed. A graph can have several (enemies, coins, the player's start). |

## Placing things

Feed an **entity output** with points - a `scatter` of a `surface`, for
coins on the ground:

```json
{"id": 6, "type": "surface", "inputs": {"in": 4}},
{"id": 7, "type": "scatter", "inputs": {"in": 6}, "params": {"chance": 0.2, "spacing": 6}},
{"id": 8, "type": "entity_output", "inputs": {"in": 7}, "params": {"max": 20},
 "component": "components/coin.component.json"}
```

Generating into a TileMap places them as its children at their cells'
centres (tagged `levelgen`); generating again replaces them. Scripts get
the same placements with `LevelGen.entities`.

## Into an LDtk level

In the editor, pick an **IntGrid** layer of a level in the Level tab, then
**Apply to LDtk Layer** in the Level Generator window: the tile output's
tiles become the layer's IntGrid values (1, 2...; empty cells 0) and the
layer's auto rules draw the tiles - the LDtk way of mapping values to art.
The Level tab's undo takes it back. (Odin: `Gen_ApplyIntGrid`.)

`seed` on a node adds to the graph's seed, so two noise nodes can differ.

## Your own nodes

**In Lua**: a **Lua Script** node (add menu > Your Own) runs a `.lua` file
that returns a function of `ctx`. **New** in its side panel writes one from
a template (`levels/<generator>_<node>.gen.lua`) and opens it in the Code
tab; **Reload** reads it again after you save it.

```lua
-- levels/islands.gen.lua: islands where input a is low, 1 = land.
return function(ctx)
    for y = 0, ctx.height - 1 do
        for x = 0, ctx.width - 1 do
            local i = y * ctx.width + x + 1
            if ctx.a[i] < ctx.params.p1 and ctx.random(x, y) < 0.8 then
                ctx.out[i] = 1
            end
        end
    end
end
```

| `ctx.` | |
|---|---|
| `width`, `height` | The level's size in cells. |
| `a`, `b` | The inputs: flat arrays, row by row, from 1 (`y * width + x + 1`); zeros when not connected. |
| `out` | The grid to fill (zeros) - or return an array of your own. |
| `params` | `p1`..`p4`: the node's numbers (set in the side panel). |
| `seed`, `random(x, y)` | The node's seed; a cell's number in [0, 1), the same every time for a seed. |

Scripts run in a sandbox of their own - `math`, `string`, `table`, no files,
no game - so a level stays the same for a seed; one that runs too long (an
endless loop) is stopped and the node shows the error, with its line.

**In Odin**: register a node type at startup (your game's, or an editor
plugin's) - it shows in the add menu and files name it by its `type`:

```odin
checker :: proc(call: ^Gen_Custom_Call) -> string {
	size := max(int(Gen_Param(call.node, "size")), 1)
	for y in 0 ..< call.out.h do for x in 0 ..< call.out.w {
		call.out.v[y * call.out.w + x] = 1 if (x / size + y / size) % 2 == 0 else 0
	}
	return "" // (or why it failed)
}
Gen_RegisterNode({name = "checker", label = "Checker", inputs = {"in"},
	params = {{name = "size", default_ = 4, integer = true}}, doc = "A checkerboard"}, checker)
```

`call.inputs` are its input grids, `call.seed` its seed (`Gen_Random01(x, y,
call.seed)`). A file with a type that isn't registered doesn't load.

## In the game: the Level Generator node

Add a **Level Generator** node with a TileMap child and pick its generator:
when the scene starts it makes a level into the map (tiles, colliders,
entities). No script needed.

| Property | |
|---|---|
| Generator | The `.levelgen.json`. |
| Tile Map | The map it fills, as a path (empty: its first TileMap child, else its parent). |
| Seed / Random Seed | A fixed level, or a new one each time - **Last Seed** says which (save it to replay the level). |
| Generate On Ready | Make a level when the scene starts. |
| Background | Make it on a worker thread while the game runs; `generated` fires when it is in. |

**Level Parameters** in the Inspector: change a generator node's value for
this node only - one generator file, many levels (denser caves later on).
**Generate Now** writes a level in the editor, to see or paint over.

```lua
local gen = self.node:get_node("Generator")
gen:set_level_param(1, "density", 0.5)      -- generator node 1's density, for this node
gen:connect("generated", function(seed) hud:show_seed(seed) end)
gen:generate()                              -- a new level (or generate(seed): that one)
```

A signal can call `generate` with no script (a "next level" button's
`clicked`). Node reference: Level Generator.

## Lua

| Function | |
|---|---|
| `LevelGen.generate(file, tilemap [, seed])` -> ok, why | Writes the level into a TileMap node - tiles and entities; `level_generated` (the map's name) is emitted on the event bus. |
| `LevelGen.values(file [, seed [, node_id]])` -> `{width, height, values}` | The grid without a tile map (row-major: `values[y * width + x + 1]`) - any node's with `node_id`. |
| `LevelGen.entities(file [, seed])` -> `{{component, x, y}, ...}` | The entity outputs' placements (cells), to spawn yourself. |

```lua
-- Put the player on the first open cell of the cave.
local g = LevelGen.values("levels/caves.levelgen.json", seed)
for y = 0, g.height - 1 do
    for x = 0, g.width - 1 do
        if g.values[y * g.width + x + 1] < 0.5 then
            player.position = Vec2((x + 0.5) * 16, (y + 0.5) * 16)
            return
        end
    end
end
```

Generate during a loading screen ([`scene_flow.md`](scene_flow.md)) for big
levels.

## From Odin

```odin
g, err := Gen_LoadFile(ctx, "levels/caves.levelgen.json")
defer Gen_GraphDestroy(&g)
Gen_ApplyTileMap(&g, tilemap, seed, ctx)               // into a TileMapNode
grid, _ := Gen_Evaluate(&g, 0, seed)                   // the output's values (any node: its id)
tiles, size, _ := Gen_Tiles(&g, 0, seed)               // tile indices (-1 = none)
r, _ := Gen_Generate(&g, seed)                         // tiles and entities, the graph computed once
text := Gen_GraphSerialize(&g)                         // back to .levelgen.json
```

Evaluating again and again (a tool, an editor) - keep a `Gen_Cache`: a node
whose settings, inputs, size, seed and script text haven't changed reuses
its grid.

```odin
cache: Gen_Cache
Gen_CacheInit(&cache)
defer Gen_CacheDestroy(&cache)
grid, _ := Gen_Evaluate(&g, id, seed, context.temp_allocator, &cache)
```

A registered node's proc may run while other evaluations do (the editor's
previews are on a worker thread): keep it free of shared state.

`GEN_KINDS` (engine/level_gen.odin) describes every built-in node type -
its inputs, parameters with defaults and help - for tools;
`Gen_NodeInfo(node)` any node's, registered ones too.
