-- A chapter is a list of steps, played in order:
--
--   "Some narration."                       -- a line with no speaker
--   { "ada", "Hello!" }                     -- a character speaks (a key of `characters`)
--   { "ada", "Hello!", pose = "cheer" }     -- ...and changes pose while saying it
--   { bg = "forest" }                       -- the background: textures/bg_forest.png
--   { show = "ada", at = "left" }           -- a character steps in: left, center or right
--   { show = "ada", pose = "think" }        -- (shown already: a new pose / place)
--   { hide = "ada" }                        -- ...and steps out
--   { set = "kind" }                        -- a flag: true (or { set = "coins", value = 3 })
--   { jump = "ending" }                     -- go on in another chapter
--   { jump = "ending", when = "kind" }      -- ...only if the flag is set
--   { choice = "Where to?", options = {     -- the player picks; each option jumps
--       { "The forest", "forest" },
--       { "Back home", "home", set = "careful" },  -- (sets a flag too)
--       { "Ask Unit", "ask", need = "kind" },      -- (only shown when a flag is set)
--   } }
--   { the_end = "The good ending" }         -- the end: back to the title screen
